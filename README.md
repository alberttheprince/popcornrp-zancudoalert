A small script to activate wanted level/military personnel aggression at Fort Zancudo that uses ox_lib zones.

Any issues must be fixed by you, **I will not provide support**. If you would like to make a PR to improve this it would be appreciated!

Dependencies:
- Ox_lib (needed for zones)
- QBox or QBcore (for job exceptions for EMS and LSPD)

Known Issues:
- If you use a resource that keeps players on the ground/in "last stand", military personnel will continue you attack you until you bleed out
- if you have qb-smallresources installed it could be that you need to turn on Config.EnableWantedLevel as seen [here](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-smallresources/blob/10af83bbd91ce73c7418de0e801870973c016532/config.lua#L50C1-L50C33)

Thanks to Aj, Chat, Joe, and Holiday from the QBox community for their help and guidance while making this small resource.
