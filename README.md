A small script to activate wanted level/military personnel aggression at Fort Zancudo that uses ox_lib zones.

Any issues must be fixed by you, **I will not provide support**. If you would like to make a PR to improve this it would be appreciated!

Dependencies:
- Ox_lib (needed for zones)
- QBox or QBcore (for job exceptions for EMS and LSPD)

Known Issues:
- If you use a resource that keeps players on the ground/in "last stand", military personnel will continue you attack you until you bleed out

Thanks to Aj, Chat, Joe, and Holiday from the QBox community for their help and guidance while making this small resource.
